@typescript-eslint/ban-types
Don't use `{}` as a type. `{}` actually means "any non-nullish value".
Don't use `Function` as a type. The `Function` type accepts any function-like value.
Don't use `Object` as a type. The `Object` type actually means "any non-nullish value", so it is marginally better than `unknown`.
- If you want a type meaning "any object", you probably want `Record<string, unknown>` instead.
- If you want a type meaning "any value", you probably want `unknown` instead 
Don't use `object` as a type. The `object` type is currently hard to use ([see this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/21732)).
